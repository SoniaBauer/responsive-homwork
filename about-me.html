          My name is Sonia Bauer.
          <br />
          I am from South Africa, where I was born and raised.
          <br />
          I am a mom of 2 boys 8-years and a 4month old baby.
          <br />
          They are my world.
          <br />
          I'm married and believe I will be a full-stack developer
          <br />
          and will be able to help provide for my family

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph2">
         I always remind myself that I'm much farther than I was before.
          <br />
          If I hadn't started then I would been still at that stage where I did
          not know anything.
          <br />
          I tell myself to look forward and not backward because backward is
          where regret is waiting for you.
