    <p id="paragraph1">
        My name is Sonia Bauer.
 I am from South Africa, where I was born and raised.
 I am a mom of 2 boys  8-years and a 4month old baby. They are my world. I'm married and believe I will be a full-stack developer and will be able to help provide for my family 
    </p>
    <p id="paragraph2">
        I always remind myself that I'm much farther than I was before. If I hadn't started then I would been still at that stage where I did not know anything.
I tell myself to look forward and not backward because backward is where regret is waiting for you.
    </p>
